# Pact Maven + Springboot + JUnit5 workshop

## Introduction

This workshop is aimed at demonstrating core features and benefits of contract testing with Pact.

Whilst contract testing can be applied retrospectively to systems, we will follow the [consumer driven contracts](https://martinfowler.com/articles/consumerDrivenContracts.html) approach in this workshop - where a new consumer and provider are created in parallel to evolve a service over time, especially where there is some uncertainty with what is to be built.

This workshop should take from 1 to 2 hours, depending on how deep you want to go into each topic.

**Workshop outline**:

- [step 1: **create consumer**](https://github.com/pact-foundation/pact-workshop-Maven-Springboot-JUnit5/tree/step1#step-1---simple-consumer-calling-provider): Create our consumer before the Provider API even exists
- [step 2: **unit test**](https://github.com/pact-foundation/pact-workshop-Maven-Springboot-JUnit5/tree/step2#step-2---client-tested-but-integration-fails): Write a unit test for our consumer
- [step 3: **pact test**](https://github.com/pact-foundation/pact-workshop-Maven-Springboot-JUnit5/tree/step3#step-3---pact-to-the-rescue): Write a Pact test for our consumer
- [step 4: **pact verification**](https://github.com/pact-foundation/pact-workshop-Maven-Springboot-JUnit5/tree/step4#step-4---verify-the-provider): Verify the consumer pact with the Provider API
- [step 5: **fix consumer**](https://github.com/pact-foundation/pact-workshop-Maven-Springboot-JUnit5/tree/step5#step-5---back-to-the-client-we-go): Fix the consumer's bad assumptions about the Provider
- [step 6: **pact test**](https://github.com/pact-foundation/pact-workshop-Maven-Springboot-JUnit5/tree/step6#step-6---consumer-updates-contract-for-missing-products): Write a pact test for `404` (missing User) in consumer
- [step 7: **provider states**](https://github.com/pact-foundation/pact-workshop-Maven-Springboot-JUnit5/tree/step7#step-7---adding-the-missing-states): Update API to handle `404` case
- [step 8: **pact test**](https://github.com/pact-foundation/pact-workshop-Maven-Springboot-JUnit5/tree/step8#step-8---authorization): Write a pact test for the `401` case
- [step 9: **pact test**](https://github.com/pact-foundation/pact-workshop-Maven-Springboot-JUnit5/tree/step9#step-9---implement-authorisation-on-the-provider): Update API to handle `401` case
- [step 10: **request filters**](https://github.com/pact-foundation/pact-workshop-Maven-Springboot-JUnit5/tree/step10#step-10---request-filters-on-the-provider): Fix the provider to support the `401` case
- [step 11: **pact broker**](https://github.com/pact-foundation/pact-workshop-Maven-Springboot-JUnit5/tree/step11#step-11---using-a-pact-broker): Implement a broker workflow for integration with CI/CD

_NOTE: Each step is tied to, and must be run within, a git branch, allowing you to progress through each stage incrementally. For example, to move to step 2 run the following: `git checkout step2`_

## Learning objectives

If running this as a team workshop format, you may want to take a look through the [learning objectives](./LEARNING.md).

## Requirements

- JDK 17+
- Maven 3+
- Docker for step 11

## Scenario

There are two components in scope for our workshop.

1. Product Catalog website. It provides an interface to query the Product service for product information.
1. Product Service (Provider). Provides useful things about products, such as listing all products and getting the details of an individual product.

## Step 1 - Simple Consumer calling Provider

We need to first create an HTTP client to make the calls to our provider service:

![Simple Consumer](diagrams/workshop_step1.svg)

The Consumer has implemented the product service client which has the following:

- `GET /products` - Retrieve all products
- `GET /products/{id}` - Retrieve a single product by ID

The diagram below highlights the interaction for retrieving a product with ID 10:

![Sequence Diagram](diagrams/workshop_step1_class-sequence-diagram.svg)

You can see the service client interface we created in `consumer/src/main/java/io/pact/workshop/product_catalogue/clients/ProductServiceClient.java`:

```java
@Service
public class ProductServiceClient {
  @Autowired
  private RestTemplate restTemplate;

  @Value("${serviceClients.products.baseUrl}")
  private String baseUrl;

  public ProductServiceResponse fetchProducts() {
    return restTemplate.getForObject(baseUrl + "/products", ProductServiceResponse.class);
  }

  public Product fetchProductById(long id) {
    return restTemplate.getForObject(baseUrl + "/products/" + id, Product.class);
  }
}
```

After forking or cloning the repository, we need to build the app and install the dependencies. Run the following
in the `consumer` sub-directory:

```console
consumer ❯ ./mvnw verify
```

We can run the app with 

```console
consumer ❯ java -jar target/product-catalogue-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
```

Accessing the URL for the app in the browser gives us a 500 error page as the downstream service is not running. 
You will also see an exception in the Springboot console output.

```
 I/O error on GET request for "http://localhost:9000/products": Connection refused
```

*Move on to [step 2](https://github.com/pact-foundation/pact-workshop-Maven-Springboot-JUnit5/tree/step2#step-2---client-tested-but-integration-fails)*

## Step 2 - Client Tested but integration fails

Now let's create a basic test for our API client. We're going to check 2 things:

1. That our client code hits the expected endpoint
1. That the response is marshalled into an object that is usable, with the correct ID

You can see the client interface test we created in `consumer/src/test/java/io/pact/workshop/product_catalogue/clients/ProductServiceClientTest.java`:

```java
  @Test
  void getProductById(@Wiremock WireMockServer server, @WiremockUri String uri) {
      productServiceClient.setBaseUrl(uri);
      server.stubFor(
          get(urlPathEqualTo("/products/10"))
              .willReturn(aResponse()
              .withStatus(200)
              .withBody("{\n" +
                  "            \"id\": 50,\n" +
                  "            \"type\": \"CREDIT_CARD\",\n" +
                  "            \"name\": \"28 Degrees\",\n" +
                  "            \"version\": \"v1\"\n" +
                  "        }\n")
              .withHeader("Content-Type", "application/json"))
      );
    
      Product product = productServiceClient.getProductById(10);
      assertThat(product, is(equalTo(new Product(10L, "28 Degrees", "CREDIT_CARD", "v1", null))));

  }
```

If you encounter failing tests after running `./mvnw verify`, make sure that the current branch is `step2`.

Meanwhile, our provider team has started building out their API in parallel. Let's run our website against our provider (you'll need two terminals to do this):

```

You should now see a screen showing 3 different products. There is a `Details ...` link which should display detailed product information.

Let's see what happens!

![Failed page](diagrams/workshop_step2_failed_page.png)

Doh! We are getting 500 everytime we try to view detailed product information. On closer inspection, 
we can see a 404 from the Product Service in the logs.

```
HttpClientErrorException$NotFound: 404 : [{"timestamp":"2021-02-25T05:27:51.264+00:00","status":404,"error":"Not Found","message":"","path":"/products/9"}]]
```

The issue is that the provider only knows about `/product/{id}` and `/products`.

We need to have a conversation about what the endpoint should be, but first...

*Move on to [step 3](https://github.com/pact-foundation/pact-workshop-Maven-Springboot-JUnit5/tree/step3#step-3---pact-to-the-rescue)*

## Step 3 - Pact to the rescue

Unit tests are written and executed in isolation of any other services. When we write tests for code that talk to
other services, they are built on trust that the contracts are upheld. There is no way to validate that the 
consumer and provider can communicate correctly.

> An integration contract test is a test at the boundary of an external service verifying that it meets the 
> contract expected by a consuming service — [Martin Fowler](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/IntegrationContractTest.html)

Adding contract tests via Pact would have highlighted the `/product/{id}` endpoint was incorrect.

Let us add Pact to the project and write a consumer pact test for the `GET /products/{id}` endpoint.

*Provider states* is an important concept of Pact that we need to introduce. These states help define the state that the provider should be in for specific interactions. For the moment, we will initially be testing the following states:

- `product with ID 10 exists`
- `products exist`

The consumer can define the state of an interaction using the `given` property.

Pact test `consumer/src/test/java/io/pact/workshop/product_catalogue/clients/ProductServiceClientPactTest.java`:

```java
@SpringBootTest
@ExtendWith(PactConsumerTestExt.class)
@PactTestFor(providerName = "ProductService")
class ProductServiceClientPactTest {
  @Autowired
  private ProductServiceClient productServiceClient;

  @Pact(consumer = "ProductCatalogue")
  public RequestResponsePact allProducts(PactDslWithProvider builder) {
    return builder
      .given("products exists")
      .uponReceiving("get all products")
      .path("/products")
      .willRespondWith()
      .status(200)
      .body(
        new PactDslJsonBody()
          .minArrayLike("products", 1, 2)
          .integerType("id", 9L)
          .stringType("name", "Gem Visa")
          .stringType("type", "CREDIT_CARD")
          .closeObject()
          .closeArray()
      )
      .toPact();
  }

  @Pact(consumer = "ProductCatalogue")
  public RequestResponsePact singleProduct(PactDslWithProvider builder) {
    return builder
      .given("product with ID 10 exists", "id", 10)
      .uponReceiving("get product with ID 10")
      .path("/products/10")
      .willRespondWith()
      .status(200)
      .body(
        new PactDslJsonBody()
          .integerType("id", 10L)
          .stringType("name", "28 Degrees")
          .stringType("type", "CREDIT_CARD")
          .stringType("code", "CC_001")
          .stringType("version", "v1")
      )
      .toPact();
  }

  @Test
  @PactTestFor(pactMethod = "allProducts", pactVersion = PactSpecVersion.V3)
  void testAllProducts(MockServer mockServer) throws IOException {
    productServiceClient.setBaseUrl(mockServer.getUrl());
    List<Product> products = productServiceClient.fetchProducts().getProducts();
    assertThat(products, hasSize(2));
    assertThat(products.get(0), is(equalTo(new Product(9L, "Gem Visa", "CREDIT_CARD", null, null))));
  }

  @Test
  @PactTestFor(pactMethod = "singleProduct", pactVersion = PactSpecVersion.V3)
  void testSingleProduct(MockServer mockServer) throws IOException {
    Product product = productServiceClient.getProductById(10L);
    assertThat(product, is(equalTo(new Product(10L, "28 Degrees", "CREDIT_CARD", "v1", "CC_001"))));
  }
}
```


![Test using Pact](diagrams/workshop_step3_pact.svg)

These tests starts a mock server on a random port that acts as our provider service. To get this to work we update the 
URL in the `ProductServiceClient` to point to the mock server that Pact provides for the test.

Running this test also passes, but it creates a pact file which we can use to validate our assumptions on the 
provider side, and have conversation around.

A pact file should have been generated in *consumer/target/pacts/ProductCatalogue-ProductService.json*

*NOTE*: even if the API client had been graciously provided for us by our Provider Team, it doesn't mean that we 
shouldn't write contract tests - because the version of the client we have may not always be in sync with the 
deployed API - and also because we will write tests on the output appropriate to our specific needs.

*Move on to [step 4](https://github.com/pact-foundation/pact-workshop-Maven-Springboot-JUnit5/tree/step4#step-4---verify-the-provider)*

## Step 4 - Verify the provider

We will need to copy the Pact contract file that was produced from the consumer test into the Provider module. 
This will help us verify that the provider can meet the requirements as set out in the contract.

Copy the contract located in `consumer/target/pacts/ProductCatalogue-ProductService.json` to `provider/pacts/ProductCatalogue-ProductService.json`.

Now let's make a start on writing a Pact test to validate the consumer contract:

In `provider/src/test/java/io/pact/workshop/product_service/PactVerificationTest.java`:

```java
@SpringBootTest(webEnvironment = SpringBootTest.WebEnvironment.RANDOM_PORT)
@Provider("ProductService")
@PactFolder("pacts")
@IgnoreMissingStateChange
public class PactVerificationTest {
  @LocalServerPort
  private int port;

  @Autowired
  private ProductRepository productRepository;

  @BeforeEach
  void setup(PactVerificationContext context) {
    context.setTarget(new HttpTestTarget("localhost", port));
  }

  @TestTemplate
  @ExtendWith(PactVerificationInvocationContextProvider.class)
  void pactVerificationTestTemplate(PactVerificationContext context) {
    context.verifyInteraction();
  }
}
```

This is a Springboot test that starts the app on a random port, and then injects the port into the test class.
We then setup the test context using some annotations on the test class that tells the Pact framework who the
provider is and where the pact files are. We also set the test target to point to the running app.

We now need to validate the pact generated by the consumer is valid by running the test, which should fail:

```console
provider ❯ ./mvnw verify

<<< Omitted >>>

1) Verifying a pact between ProductCatalogue and ProductService - get product with ID 10: has status code 200

    1.1) status: expected status of 200 but was 404

    1.2) body: $ Expected code='CC_001' but was missing

        {
        -  "code": "CC_001",
        -  "id": 10,
        -  "name": "28 Degrees",
        -  "type": "CREDIT_CARD",
        -  "version": "v1"
        +  "timestamp": "2021-02-26T02:50:41.293+00:00",
        +  "status": 404,
        +  "error": "Not Found",
        +  "message": "",
        +  "path": "/products/10"
        }

<<< Omitted >>>
    
```

![Pact Verification](diagrams/workshop_step4_pact.svg)

The test has failed, as the expected path `/products/{id}` is returning 404. We incorrectly believed our provider was following a RESTful design, but the authors were too lazy to implement a better routing solution 🤷🏻‍♂️.

The correct endpoint which the consumer should call is `/product/{id}`.

Move on to [step 5](https://github.com/pact-foundation/pact-workshop-Maven-Springboot-JUnit5/tree/step5#step-5---back-to-the-client-we-go)

## Step 5 - Back to the client we go

We now need to update the consumer client and tests to hit the correct product path.

First, we need to update the GET route for the client:

In `consumer/src/main/java/io/pact/workshop/product_catalogue/clients/ProductServiceClient.java`:

```java
  public Product getProductById(long id) {
    return restTemplate.getForObject(baseUrl + "/product/" + id, Product.class);
  }
```

Then we need to update the Pact test `ID 10 exists` to use the correct endpoint in `path`.

In `consumer/src/test/java/io/pact/workshop/product_catalogue/clients/ProductServiceClientPactTest.java`:

```java
  @Pact(consumer = "ProductCatalogue")
  public RequestResponsePact singleProduct(PactDslWithProvider builder) {
    return builder
      .given("product with ID 10 exists", "id", 10)
      .uponReceiving("get product with ID 10")
        .path("/product/10")
      .willRespondWith()
        .status(200)
        .body(
          new PactDslJsonBody()
            .integerType("id", 10L)
            .stringType("name", "28 Degrees")
            .stringType("type", "CREDIT_CARD")
            .stringType("code", "CC_001")
            .stringType("version", "v1")
        )
      .toPact();
  }
```

![Pact Verification](diagrams/workshop_step5_pact.svg)

Let's run and generate an updated pact file on the consumer:

```console
consumer ❯ ./mvnw verify

<<< Omitted >>>

Now we run the provider tests again with the updated contract

Copy the updated contract located in `consumer/target/pacts/ProductCatalogue-ProductService.json` to `provider/pacts`.

Run the command:

```console
provider ❯ ./mvnw verify
